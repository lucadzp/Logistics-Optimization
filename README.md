ðŸ“¦ Logistics Optimization App â€“ Construction Material Deliveries

Optimize delivery routes for construction materials using Operations Research techniques.

This app helps to minimize delivery distances and travel time by applying heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms, while managing multiple vehicles and capacity constraints.

ðŸ›  Key Features
	â€¢	Manage depots, vehicles, delivery points, and orders using SQL.
	â€¢	Optimize delivery routes with heuristic & metaheuristic algorithms.
	â€¢	Generate efficient delivery schedules to reduce costs.

ðŸ’» Technologies
	â€¢	Languages: Python, Java, C++
	â€¢	Database: MySQL / PostgreSQL
	â€¢	Algorithms: Heuristic & Metaheuristic (Genetic Algorithm, Tabu Search, etc.)

ðŸš€ Impact
	â€¢	Improved delivery efficiency and reduced total travel distance in simulations.
	â€¢	Demonstrates practical use of Operations Research in logistics optimization.
